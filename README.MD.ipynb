    "# Data Visualization and D3.js: On-Time Arrival Stats by Airport and Year \n",
    "by Mohammad Yaqoob for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud507-nd)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This data visualization is designed to shows which airlines will have 80% or greater On-Time Arrival Rates for a selected Airport and Year.  I also wanted to communicate the story that user selected airport and year, on average how much the categories of security, carrier, and weather impact airlines performance by graphing their averages by months, allowing users to see what factors contribute the most to airpot and airline delays.  The data is downloaded from [RITA](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/ot_delaycause1.asp?display=download&pn=0&month=12&year=2015)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the data from [RITA](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/ot_delaycause1.asp?display=download&pn=0&month=12&year=2015) I decided to open the csv file to look briefly into the data.  There was nothing otu of the ordinary and the data look pretty crisp and clean.  Fortunately, I didn't need to perform any data cleaning and wrangling with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "I used d3.csv to read in the csv file for exploratory data analysis.  The initial plot did not look to deliver the relationship that I was looking for i.e. airlines on-time greater or equal to 80% and categories contributing to on-time performance for airport and airlines as shown in the following graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/EDA1.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the provided data, it can be sliced and diced to address my question i.e. \"For a given airport and year, which airlines are 80% or greater on-time and how factors like weather, security, and carrier delay impact their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization using dimple.js\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to improve upon the initial data visualization further using  **D3.js** and **dimple.js** using iterative design design and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I modified graphing options to plot all airlines and this was clearly very busy graph too. The scatter plot by itself did not show anything meaningful or distinguishable trends as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/EDA2.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I decided to add a line chart with multiple series that will show different trends across different airlines.  I first produced a cursory plot to explore this idea the plot shows on-time trends for the airlines with most airlines on-time rate greater than 50%:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/EDA3.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though plot is clearly busy, it does show some airline on-time trends i.e. effect of Weather.  As we see the On-time performance degrade in certain months that one can relate to weather impact.  This chart is satisfactory in visualizing the this trend for the airlines arriving at the selected airport during the selected year.  It shows how various airlines improved or worsened from month to month, and which airlines performed better for the selected year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address the second part of the question as to what factors impact the on-time arrival and how , I decided to look into plotting weather, security, and carrier on-time aveages for the month. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using inspiration from examples at [dimplejs.org](http://dimplejs.org/advanced_examples_viewer.html?id=advanced_trellis_bar) I read weather, security, and carrier related data and calculated averages for each month in the give year and plotted trellis bar graph to high light the impact on the on-time performance of airlines for those months at the selected airport and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial iteration can be viewed at `index2.html`, or below:\n",

    "## Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "To get feedback and enhance my the graphs, I first posted request on the Google+ with the [gist](https://gist.github.com/myaqoob67/1a3db6ee4a3b915eee28) location. I received one response from Mohammed Mahdi Akkouh asking me to add my presentation to [bl.ocks.org] (http://bl.ocks.org).  I completed uploading visualization but encountered an issue where the thumbnail was not displaying. Screenshot for the request on Google+ as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/Feedback_Request1.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I did not receive any further responses.  Hence, I decided to show the visualiazation to three of my colleagues at work and get their feedback and to improve the visulaization in the light of their feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback #1: Tom Pelicano\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you notice in the visualization?\n",
    "\t- I noticed carrier arrival rates by month for an airport.  I stated playing around and noticed selection can be refined by an airport and or by year.\n",
    "- What questions do you have about the data?\n",
    "\t- I noticed the initial visualization shows one line, is that due to data?  I saw the sample data you provided below it seems there may be some abnormal sorting going on as all the points are 100%.\n",
    "\t- Can relationship be enhanced let say by data wrangling?\n",
    "- What relationships do you notice?\n",
    "\t- I noticed I can relate the ups and lows of arrival rates to weather, carrier, security averages.  There is a relation but graphs stacked vertical makes is difficult to see.\n",
    "- What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?\n",
    "\t- I noticed that the biggest cause of carrier delay is either carrier itself or the weather .\n",
    "- Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?\n",
    "\t- I noticed the graph heading is little confusing.  Can it be changed to better reflect the relationship?\n",
    "\t- Can the monthly graph be changed to display user friendly month names instead of numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom's email respond's screenshot is shown below.\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/Feedback1.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback #2: Jason Yao\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you notice in the visualization?\n",
    "\t- Too Many things to look at specially the buttons.\n",
    "\t- Airport and year by selection idea is good, but then buttons confuses the graph output.\n",
    "\t- It is difficult to analyze what data points belong to which carrier in a busy graph.\n",
    "- What questions do you have about the data?\n",
    "\t- I would like to see easier way to see the lines belonging to a carrier in the top graph.\n",
    "- What relationships do you notice?\n",
    "\t- Carrier on-time arrival graph shows large and small carriers follow the same weather and carrier related behavior.\n",
    "- What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?\n",
    "\t- I can select my airport and see which airlines scored better on on-time arrival performance .\n",
    "- Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?\n",
    "\t- Why the two graphs are not side by side?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jason's email respond's screenshot is shown below.\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/Feedback2.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Feedback #3: Sagar Joshi\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you notice in the visualization?\n",
    "\t- Initially, the left graph only shows one straight line around 100% , but I saw changes after I started choosing different airport or year.  Initially, the top graph did not make much sense until I scroll down to second graph.\n",
    "\t- The buttons next to submit i.e. “Top 5 on-time” etc are unnecessary as the top graph already depict most of this relationship. I think these can be removed as these are unnecessary distraction.\n",
    "- What questions do you have about the data?\n",
    "\t- I did not understand the what is the selection criteria for the carrier to be visible in the top graph.  Is it certain on-time threshold? And can it be added to the graph somewhere so it is not confusing.\n",
    "- What relationships do you notice?\n",
    "\t- Carrier on-time performance is related on their on-time performance with respect to weather or carrier delay, and security doesn’t have much effect on the arrival performance.\n",
    "- What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?\n",
    "\t- Carrier delay is the biggest drag on the on-time performance of the carrier.\n",
    "- Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?\n",
    "\t- It is difficult to see the relationships since the graphs one after the other.  One has to scroll down to see the other graph.\n",
    "\t- Month numbers on the second graph is not very friendly, can it be transitioned to month names instead.\n",
    "\t- The top graph is difficult to read as there are many lines, can airlines line graph be emphasized when it is clicked etc.?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Post Feedback Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I reviewed the feedback from my colleagues and marked the initial iteration to reflect the chnages that I would like to implement for the final visualization.  My changes to be implemented are mapped to the initial iteration are shown in the below image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../master/img/Feedback_mapping.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of the changes that I am implementing to address feedback from colleagues are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change Month numbers to Month names.\n",
    "- Move the location of the monthly category average trellis graph to the right location.\n",
    "- Remove the Buttons just keep `Submit` button.  Though I will keep the source code as comments for future enhancements.\n",
    "- Fix the Month number display in the `From Month` and `To Month` selection from `NaN` month numbers.\n",
    "- Fix the Display on the scatter and line graph to sort flights by on-time sort order and plot those that have arrival performance of atleast 80%.\n",
    "- add a `mouseover` event for the lines so it would emphasize the path to allow for better understanding of each individual carrier.\n",
    "- I changed the chart title to be more consistent with the data presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose not to include the arrival data and raw numbers.  I didn't think that it was the focus of the chart, or had any impact on the understanding of airline on-time arrival rates.\n",
    "\n",
